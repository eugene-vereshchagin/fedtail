## Plans

Each feature comes switchable, one at a time, with its entry here and a line in the CHANGELOG. The order is rough: the cheap first, the big later.

| What | Chapter | Config | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sync: WebDAV, a snapshot of the journal | Read marks and place | `[sync]` | medium |
| Toga (BeeWare) | Interfaces | — | large |

## Won't do

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| Subscribing to old threads in a batch | Taken off the queue. |
| Boost carousel | Sideways is awkward to read, and it fits badly with “nothing jumps” and read marks. Boosts are hidden with the filter, per person or with a list. |
| Card templates (like tut's `toot.tmpl`) | A theme already sets the look of the whole app; a second layer of templates over themes adds nothing. |
| AI helpers in the compose panel (as in Ice Cubes) | Writing is the author's job. |
| A node admin panel in the client | Sitting in a client logged in as an admin is irresponsible. If a node ever needs setting up, there'll be a separate tool for it. |
| Mastodon's annual report | It's about neither reading nor conversation. |
| An XMPP gateway | Taken off the queue. |

## Not there and not decided

| What | Others | Note |
|---|---|---|
| The token from an external command (`pass`, `gopass`) | tut | It's unclear what this would add over a file readable by its owner only. |
